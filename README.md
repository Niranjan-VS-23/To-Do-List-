# To-Do List 📝

A simple, interactive **To-Do List** web application that allows users to add and delete tasks. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project is a great starting point for understanding DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features ✨

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.  
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from their list with a simple "Delete" button.  
- **Validation**: Ensures users cannot add empty tasks.  
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Tasks are added and deleted dynamically without reloading the page.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Adding a Task**:
   - Enter the task in the input box and click the "Add Task" button.
   - The task will appear as a list item in the to-do list.

2. **Deleting a Task**:
   - Each task has a "Delete" button.
   - Click the button to remove the task from the list.

3. **Validation**:
   - If the input box is empty, the user is prompted to enter a task.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
